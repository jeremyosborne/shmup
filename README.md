# shmup

Shoot em up. Current version of code should be hosted on this project's github pages at http://jeremyosborne.github.io/shmup.

This is more of my rubber duck hacking with [Phaser](http://phaser.io) and video game ideas than anything serious.



## Build the Game

* Get [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).

* Optional: Get [Gulp](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started):

        npm install -g gulp

* Install other build tools:

        npm install

* Run dev server:

        npm start
        # or `gulp` if you have installed gulp globally

* Run game in modern browser
    * go to: http://localhost:4242

* The `bower.json` can be ignored unless you wish to update the third party libraries used.



## Playing the game

Shoot thing with your dino. Don't get hit by the pigs.
